// This shows how to integrate Ethereum into your existing main.dart
// You would add this to your main navigation

/*
Add this to your main navigation options:

case 4: // Add Ethereum as a new tab
  return EthereumNavigationScreen();

And update your bottom navigation to include:
BottomNavigationBarItem(
  icon: Icon(Icons.account_balance_wallet),
  label: 'Ethereum',
),

Or integrate it into your existing Crypto tab by replacing
the CryptoScreen with a tabbed interface that includes both
multi-chain assets and Ethereum DeFi features.
